Gogodze Phu Vol II is a sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.933 or newer. It contains samples of a kick, snare, three toms and a hi-hat, vaguely trying to sound like the drums on Kim Jung Mi's "Now" album from 1973.

To register the Sforzando bank, drag the Gogodze Phu Vol II.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, the instrument will be available in the Sforzando loading menu and the GUI will work.
